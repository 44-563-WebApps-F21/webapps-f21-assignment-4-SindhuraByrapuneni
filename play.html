        <h3>The Duchess of Padua</h3>
        <h5>ACT II.       _Room in the Duke’s Palace_ (36 _minutes_).</h5>
            <p class=stage-direction>Enter DUKE, MAFFIO, and Lord Cardinal</p>

            <h6 class="name DUKE"> DUKE</h6>
            <p class="speech">  No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
                Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.</p>

            <p class=stage-direction>MAFFIO</p>

            <p class="speech">  Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
                Who every moment grow more clamorous.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">DUKE</p>

            <p class="speech">Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!
                People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;
                The only men I fear are silent men.</p>
            

            <p class="stage-direction">Cardinal</p>

            <p class="speech">Go, Petrucci,
                And tell the captain of the guard below
                To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?
                Do what I bid you.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">CARDINAL</p>

            <p class="speech">I beseech your Grace
                To listen to their grievances.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">DUKE</p>

            <p class="speech"> Ay! the peaches
                Are not so big this year as they were last.
                I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,
                I thought you spake of peaches.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">GUIDO</p>

            <p class="speech"> The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
                And stands between the people and the guard,
                And will not let them shoot.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">DUKE</p>

            <p class="speech">The devil take her!</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">GUIDO</p>

            <p class="speech">And followed by a dozen of the citizens
                Has come into the Palace.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">DUKE</p>

            <p class="speech">By Saint James,
                Our Duchess waxes bold!</p>

            <h6 class="name BARDI">BARDI</h6>
            <p class="speech"> Here comes the Duchess.</p>

            <h6 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h6>
            <p class="speech">Shut that door there; this morning air is cold.</p>

            <h6 class="name DUCHESS">DUCHESS</h6>
            <p class="speech">I do beseech your Grace to give us audience.</p>

            <h6 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h6>
            <p class="speech">What are these grievances?</p>

            <h6 class="name DUCHESS">DUCHESS</h6>
            <p class="speech"> Alas, my Lord,
                Such common things as neither you nor I,
                Nor any of these noble gentlemen,
                Have ever need at all to think about;
                They say the bread, the very bread they eat,
                Is made of sorry chaff.</p>

            <h6 class="name FIRST CITIZEN">FIRST CITIZEN</h6>
            <p class="speech">Ay! so it is,
                Nothing but chaff</p>
              

                <p class="stage-direction">DUKE</p>

                <h6 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h6>
                <p class="speech">  And very good food too,
                    I give it to my horses.</p>
    
                <h6 class="name DUCHESS">DUCHESS</h6>
                <p class="speech"> They say the water,
                    Set in the public cisterns for their use,
                    [Has, through the breaking of the aqueduct,]
                    To stagnant pools and muddy puddles turned.</p>
    
                <p class="stage-direction">enternace of SECOND CITIZEN</p>
    
                <p class="speech"> Alack, your Grace, the taxes which the customs
                    Take at the city gate are grown so high
                    We cannot buy wine.</p>
    
                <p class="stage-direction">Re-enter DUCHESS</p>
    h
                <p class="speech">Think, while we sit
                    In gorgeous pomp and state, gaunt poverty
                    Creeps through their sunless lanes, and with sharp knives
                    Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily
                    And no word said.</p>
