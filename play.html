    <h3>Guido Ferranti - a Young Man</h3>
    <p><br>[_Enter_ GUIDO FERRANTI _and_ ASCANIO CRISTOFANO.]
     Now by my life, Guido, I will go no farther; for if I walk anotherstep I will have no life left to swear by; this wild-goose errand of
     yours!</br>
    <br>GUIDO
    I think it must be here.  [_Goes up to passer-by and doffs his cap_.]Pray, sir, is this the market place, and that the church of Santa
    Croce?  [_Citizen bows_.]  I thank you, sir.</br>
    <br>GUIDO
    Ay! it is here.</br>   
  <br>GUIDO
   [_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.]  ‘The hour noon;the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip’s
        Day.’</br>
   <br>GUIDO [_reading still_]
    ‘I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on theshoulder.’  A brave attire, Ascanio.</br>
    <br>GUIDO
     Why, yes!  It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a
     man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would
     know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise thewriter!  I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me
    that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge bysome one he had never since seen.</br>
    <br>GUIDO [_smiling_]
    I am sure you never deserved it.</br>
    <br>GUIDO
    Noon.</br>
    <br>GUIDO [_laughing_]
    Nay, nay, I doubt not that he has come to tell That I am some great Lord of Italy,And we will have long days of joy together.Within the hour, dear Ascanio.</br>
   <br>GUIDO [_proudly_]
    Then when you saw my noble father lastHe was set high above the heads of men?</br></p>
